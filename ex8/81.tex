\subsection*{8.2 Geometry of Linear Classification}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item
The decision boundary is a hyperplane defined by $(w^Tx + b = 0)$. $w$ decides the orientation,
$b$ decides the offset from the origin. $w$ points in the direction of positive classification values $y(x)$. (Figure \ref{820})
\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{820.png}
    \caption{}
	\label{820}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item the decision boundary is given by $\{x\;|\;w^Tx + b=0\}$
\item in the 2-dimensional case this can be expressed as: $x_1 = \;-\frac{w_0}{w_1}x_0 \;-\; \frac{b}{w_1}$
\item as one can see, the slope of the boundary is $\;-\frac{w_0}{w_1}$ and the offset is $\;-\frac{b}{w_1}$
    \item figure \ref{821}: $w_0$ only affects the slope
    \item figure \ref{822}: varying $w_1$ also results in different offsets
    \item figure \ref{823}: increasing $b$ leads to a negative offset, scaled by $w_1$
\end{itemize}

\item
A linear classifier divides the input space into two half-spaces. The \textit{shattering coefficient} $s_{halfspaces}(n)$ then is the largest number of subsets that can be formed by intersecting \textit{any} one input set $X$ of $n$ points using half-spaces. The highest possible shattering coefficient is $2^{n}$.

$s_{H}(n) = \underset{X \subseteq \Omega, |X| = n}{max}\ |\{X \cap H_i \mid H_i \in H\}|$

Similarly, the VC dimension can be interpreted as the largest number of data points, that can be separated in all possible ways by the functions contained in the space H (Rychetsky (2001), p.15-16).
It provides a measure of the capacity of the separation capabilities of the separator function class H. If we can find n points, that can be shattered by H (that is, H can separate all possible binary labelings of the points), then VC(H) = n. It is sufficient, that some such example of n points exists (fixed points, but H must shatter them for all possible labelings).

For a linear classifier in 2 input dimensions, the VC-dimension is 2 (it cannot cannot shatter 3 points, which lie on a line). 

Small VC-dimensions are often applicable for real life data, since close points will have same labels, so separator classes with low VC-dimensions (low complexity models) might actually be preferrable.
Correct linear classification is possible, if all classes can be bounded by non-overlapping convex domains.

\subsection*{8.3 The primal SRM problem}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item
The margin is the lowest distance between the decision boundary and the closest datapoints. The margin of a canonical hyperplane is set to be $d = \frac{1}{|w|}$ by choosing $|w|$ appropriately.
A low margin means higher model complexity $C$, which means we might get a worse upper bound for the generalization error $E^G < E^T + C$, even if the separate the training set perfectly (overfitting).
A high margin reduces model complexity, but increases the training error (underfitting).
\item
\input{83b}
\item
Primal Problem:

minimize $f_{0}(x)$ subject to $f_{k}(x) \leq 0$, $k=1,...,m$, which in our case is:

minimize $\frac{1}{2}|w|^2$ subject to $-y_T^{(\alpha)}((w^Tx^{(\alpha)}+b)-1) \leq 0$

This means we wish to find the largest margin $\frac{1}{|w|}$, that seperates all training datapoints:

$y_T^{(\alpha)}(w^Tx^{(\alpha)} + b) \geq 1 \quad \forall \alpha$

holds for
$y_T^{(\alpha)} \in \{-1, 1\}, \quad \forall \alpha$ and

$ w^Tx^{(\alpha)} + b \geq y_T^{(\alpha)} \quad \forall y_T^{(\alpha)} = 1$,

$ w^Tx^{(\alpha)} + b \leq y_T^{(\alpha)} \quad \forall y_T^{(\alpha)} = -1$

The constraint term at the top is just a concise rewrite of these 2 inequalities.

Since the objective function $\frac{1}{2}|w|^2$ is convex, it only has one optimal solution. And since this is a standard formulation, we can use solvers to solve it.
The solution should classify all training points perfectly ($E^T = 0$), while minimizing the complexity $C$.

\subsection*{8.5 Kernel Construction}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item kernel matrix is symmetric:
\begin{eqnarray}
K(x,x')\;=\;\phi(x)^T\,\phi(x')\;=\;\phi(x')^T\,\phi(x)\;=\;K(x',x)
\end{eqnarray}
\item kernel matrix is positive semidefinite:
\begin{eqnarray}
a^T K a\;=\;\sum^P_{i,j=0} a_i a_j K_{ij}\;=\;\sum^P_{i,j=0}a_i a_j \langle \phi(x_i), \phi(x_j) \rangle \\
= \langle\; \sum^P_{i=0}a_i \phi(x_i) \;,\; \sum^P_{j=0} a_j \phi(x_j)\;\rangle \;=\; || \sum_{i=0}^P a_i \phi(x_i) ||^2 \;\geq\;0
\end{eqnarray}
\item sum of two kernels is also a valid kernel:
\begin{itemize}
\item the sum of two symmetric matrices is (obviously) also symmetric and the sum of two positive semidefinite matrices is positive semidefinte as well:
\end{itemize}
\begin{eqnarray}
a^T (K_1\;+\;K_2) a\;=\;a^T K_1 \,a\;+\;a^T K_2 \,a\;=\;c_1\;+\;c_2\;\geq\;0
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{itemize}
\item this makes the sum of those matrices also a valid kernel, as Mercer's theorem states (Haykin - \textit{"Neural Networks - A Comprehensive Foundation"},$\;2^{\mbox{\tiny{nd}}}$ Ed., p. 331)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
